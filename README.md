Hi there!

I am a software engineer from Israel, Netanya.

I'm working for tech companies on the following technologies:

Node.js: +4 years of expirience.  
PostgreSQL: My go-to database for large server applications.  
Docker: Worked with Docker in production for years.  
Nginx, Redis, RabbitMQ, WebSockets. 
Frontend: React

I'm mainly working on the backend/infrastructure side,   
but I have strong skills in the frontend and graphic design as well.
