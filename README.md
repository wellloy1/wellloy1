Hi there!

I am a software engineer from Israel, live in Netanya.

I'm working for tech companies on the following technologies:

Node.js: +4 years of XP.  
PostgreSQL: My go-to database for large server applications.  
Docker: Worked with Docker in production for years.  
WebSockets, Redis, RabbitMQ.  

In learning of Rust now (It's awesome!).  

I'm mainly working on the backend/infrastructure side,   
but I have strong skills in the frontend and graphic design as well.
